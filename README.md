# Citywide Footprinting iOS Repository
This is the repository for the Citywide Footprinting iOS application from the Intelligent and Connected Systems Laboratory at Columbia University. 
For any questions, contact Peter Wei at pw2428@columbia.edu or Professor Xiaofan Jiang at xj2179@columbia.edu.

The CitywideFootprinting repository is the main project repo. We will soon setup a website for this project. Stay tuned!
The application will also be uploaded to the iOS App Store when development has finished.
